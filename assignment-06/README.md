1. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these
elements different, or what role do they play?
There can only be one main document element.

The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.
Semantic markup is a way of writing and structuring your HTML so that it reinforces the semantics, or meaning, of the content rather than its appearance. Structure is the information components within an HTML document.HTML provides some elements that are strictly "structural" - meaning that they are used to define the structure for a web page, in semantic terms. Structural markup encodes information about an element's role.
