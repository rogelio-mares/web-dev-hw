# Assignment 9
1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or
difficult to learn?
With my experiences learning html i thought going into a deeper depths of divs was pretty new for me, and i thought it
was pretty cool going back and looking at tables and using everything we have used so far for this assignment. Although i thought this assignment was i hard i still had a lot of fun with it
2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us
"decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in
this new section?
Im anxious that I will struggle and get lost like how i did with this assignment but im excited to work through it and go into a deeper depths
3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes. What did you do to
overcome your challenges?
i struggled a lot with the divs since we're pretty new to them, im still not sure what all of them do, and how to apply them all to everything i wanted. I also messed a bunch trying to figure out how i wanted my elements to look nicer. Overall after looking through old modules and watching your examples i was able to help myself!
