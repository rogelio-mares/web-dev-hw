# Assignment 8
1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

Divs- The div tag is a block level HTML element. It is used to divide or section of other HTML tags in to meaningful groups.

Classes- If a page had multiple sidebar chunks, we might want to make one class so that we could use CSS to style each chunk with one rule.

Ids- The id attribute is used to label sections or parts of your HTML document. You may only use the same id once per page, so save it for important major sections of your page. Additionally, the id selector in CSS has a high specificity level and therefore overrules other things.

Spans- The span tag is an inline HTML element that is used to group a set of inline elements. Generally speaking, you use span to hook text or a group of tags that you want to style differently. Often though, you can do this more semantically by using other elements like em or strong.
